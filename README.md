# Dot Files

This repo contains the common dotfiles I use

## `.*rc`

These dotfiles are for shell customization, in case you don't know that... The shell-specific `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` files are set to also source the distro-specific dot file (for now just `.archrc`).

* `.zshrc` - My ZSH config, complete with external `ZSH2000` theme and some OhMyZ.sh plugins.
* `.archrc` - My personal config additions that are specialized for Arch-based distros.
* `.bashrc` - IDK if I'll ever go back to bash, but it's probably a good idea to include these as well
